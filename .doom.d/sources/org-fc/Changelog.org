* Changelog
I hope the current card / log format is flexible enough to accommodate
upcoming changes.

In case a update to the org sources is needed, I'll add a changelog
entry with updating instructions.

** 0.1.0

- Support for setting audio files to play after flipping a card via
  ~org-fc-audio-set-after-flip~

  argument, this has been fixed

**** Internal
The AWK scripts now generate S-expressions instead of CSV tables, this
way ~read~ can be used to parse the data instead of relying on a set
of custom parsing functions.

This also allows passing more complex data structures from AWK to
org-fc.
*** [2020-04-29 Wed]
Implemented a new version of the spacing algorithm (SM2) that's used
by org-fc.

The only difference is in how the next interval for cards rated as
"hard" is calculate.

The initial version (~'sm2-v1~) would decrease the ease factor by
0.15, then calculate the next interval by multiplying the previous
interval with the new ease factor.

In the new version (~'sm2-v2~), the interval is always multiplied by a
factor of 1.2, similar to the version of SM2 used by Anki.

~org-fc-algorithm~ can be used to set which version of the
algorithm should be used, defaulting to ~'sm2-v1~.

Once I have evaluated the performance of the new algorithm,
the default version will change to ~'sm2-v2~.
*** [2020-04-12 Sun]
**** Added
- =text-input= card type
*** [2020-02-08 Sat]
**** Changed

**** Added

*** [2020-02-03 Mon]
**** Internal
- ~org-fc-due-positions-for-paths~ now shuffles the lists of positions
  using an Emacs Lisp function instead of depending on =shuf=
- All awk-indexer functions now use ~gawk~ instead of ~awk~
